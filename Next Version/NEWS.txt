Version 3.0:

- Processing is now described in an script (ESP code executes this script),
- The script is read sequentially and indefinitely,
- The web page can be exported to a NodeJS server,
- The web interface is closely linked to the nature of the processing (one script == one web ui),
- The web interface interacts with the process described by the script (by sending script commands itself),
- The web interface can also modify parts of the script (specially the I/O configuration parameters),
- The script can be loaded by html request,
